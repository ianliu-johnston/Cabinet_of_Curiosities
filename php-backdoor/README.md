# Obfuscated PHP backdoor
This came into my logs, and I had to Deobfuscate it to see what it was doing. It was very tedious because I still have to figure out how to automate that process... Stay tuned for that eventually.

## Description
This backdoor is called the "Filesman" PHP backdoor, and leverages vulnerable Wordpress plugins. It was uploaded to my server from a GET request (oddly enough)
