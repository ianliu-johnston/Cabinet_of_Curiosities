    <h2>Intro:</h2>
    <p>This website is made for the <a href="/admin/i18n/readme.txt" target="_blank"><img src="wp-content/images/wp-logo.swf" alt="ERROR LOG" ></a> admission process. I started out the process of making this website with a little bit of pre-knowledge of how to code in HTML, but along the way learned a ton about the process. Coding takes patience, especially through the command line. Things are not quite what you think they will be initially, but the more you poke around, the more you can adapt to the mindset it takes to figure things out.</p>

    <h3>Brainstorming:</h3>
      <p>The process started from <a href="/chaos.html" style="text-decoration: underline;" target="_blank">chaos and randomness.</a> This first page was more of a sketch, but I progressed through the tutorials with them, creating the header, footer, navbar, comments section, social media share buttons and writing Javascript to make a picture bigger and smaller when the user clicks, like this:</p>
<img src="/img/cloud.png" id="smart_thumbnail" class="small" alt="it's just a cloud..."/>
<p>I kind of wanted to make an art website, but also kind of wanted to make some sort of story that happened as someone navigated throught the website, but the two ended up colliding into <a href="/oneiromancy.html" style="text-decoration: underline;" target="_blank">just randomness, hold the chaos.</a>
	<p>I built a <a href="/template.html" target="_blank">template</a> so I could copy and paste content into the &lt;article&gt; tags. This was all in an attempt to generate content for the site and familiarize myself with the command line interface, which turned out to be very excellent for my Linux literacy. My favorite page was the most simple one. <a href="/nothingness.html" target="_blank">The "Nothingness Page"</a></p>

<p>I have a very powerful computer that I use for video and audio processing for work. It is also very large, and sucks up a ton of power when its on. Not very portable. I mean, if I wanted to, I could probably hook up a couple car batteries on a makeshift cart and wheel it around behind me... but... I'd rather carry something around in my bag.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the computer cost a fortune to build, so I did not have any money to buy a laptop at the time, and remained fairly broke since then. But Fortunately, a co-worker gave me a couple of old laptops that she was going to throw away.</p>
<img class="small" src="/img/thinkpad_T40.jpg" alt="This is my model of laptop."/>
<p>It was way too slow to do anything (I mean anything) on and I was consciously rejecting computers when not at work so I threw them in the pile of old electronics in my room. (I mean, I work at a screen all day and if unchecked, will look at a screen all night too.) But the time came when I realized I actually needed a laptop, so I picked up the good one and found out that I can install a very lightweight version of Linux, called <a href="http://lubuntu.net" target="_blank">Lubuntu</a>. It's what I'm typing on this very moment. It turned out to be usably fast, and I felt very accomplished at having recycled some old piece of junk.</p>
<p><em>It's still not perfect though, the more I use it, the worse it gets. Some of the keys are shiny from fingers typing on them so much. We'll just see how long this will last for, or if I can keep on fixing it with bandaids and duct tape. (It's probably around 15 years old at this point.)</em></p>
<p style="font-size: 0.85em;">I'm highly enjoying a mildly functioning laptop at this point, because it means I don't have to spend all day and night at work, I'm not bound by my rig. I'm free! Ah... oh... this dang thing... monitor... glitching out again...my big computer never does this...<p style="font-size: 0.75em"><em>...mumble...mumble...</em></p>

<h2>Building From The Command Line:</h2>
<div class="col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-xs-7">
<h3>Basics:</h3>
<p>I saw this website as a challenge to get to know the Linux environment better, so I built this website entirely from within the Command Line Interface on my remote server. I did not use any text editors on my local machine. This means that I had to figure out how to do all of it without a Graphical User Interface. I used commands like <code>wget http://example.com</code>, <code>sed</code> (see below), <code>emacs file.html</code>, <code>head -n 25 file.html &gt; header.txt</code>, <code>echo some text &gt;&gt; file.html</code>, <code> touch emptyFile.html</code> and lots of <code>ssh</code>, <code>cd</code>, <code>ls</code>, <code>cp</code>, <code>mkdir</code>, <code>rm -r directory</code> and <code>rm</code>. Some of the images, I had to edit on my local machine and upload to the remote server with <code>scp picture.png root@thewebsite/filepath</code>.</p>

<div class="col-lg-5 col-md-5 col-xs-5">
<h3>Backups:</h3>
<p>This was a crucial element of the process. I ended up making a series of archives that backed up my website</p>
<p>These are the steps that I took to create them:</p>
<ol>
<li>Make a folder called bkups in /var/www/ with this command: <code>mkdir bkups</code>.</li>
<li>Create a batch script to copy all Javascript, CSS, and HTML files into it: <blockquote style="overflow-x: scroll; white-space: nowrap;"><p><code>echo cp *.html *.css *.js &gt;&gt; backItUp.sh</code></p><p><code>echo tar -zcvf bkupArchive.tar.gz bkups &gt;&gt; backItUp.sh</code></p></blockquote></li>
<li>Make the batch script executable: <code>chmod +x backItUp.sh</code></li>
<li>Run it when I need to backup: <code>./backItUp.sh</code></li>
</ol>

    <h3>The <a href="http://www.grymoire.com/Unix/Sed.html" style="text-decoration: underline;" target="_blank">sed</a> Command:</h3>
    <p> Pretty far along in the process, I discovered an easier way to modify all of the documents on my HTML site. This marvelous utility simply called <em>'sed'</em>. (The link in the previous headline is to a tutorial about sed.) I kept wanting to change the navigation bar to include the new pages, or delete the random ones, and I didn't want to have to go back and hand type it every time. Even with the template file I generated, I still had to copy paste the content back in. Tedium. After a little bit of googling, I found this command:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <code>sed -i 's/patternToReplace/ReplacingPattern/g' file.html</code>
    </blockquote>
    <p>I tried it out on a copied template.html file, and viola! It changed just that one line to be correct. I tried listing more files like this:</p>
    <blockquote>
     <code>sed -i 's/pattern/replacement/g' file1.html file2.html file3.html file4.html file5.html</code>
    </blockquote>
    <p>That worked too! Now I had a functional command, but there were pitfalls to this method too.<a href="/mistakes.html" style="text-decoration: underline;"> See this page for some mistakes I made.</a></p>
    <p>Here are the different permutations of the sed command I used:</p>
    <blockquote style="overflow-x: scroll; white-space: nowrap;">
      <p><code>sed -i 's/pattern/replacement/g' file.html file2.html #replaces a pattern with another pattern</code></p>
      <p><code>sed -i '25i&lt;li&gt;List item to insert at line number 25&lt;/li&gt;' file.html #inserts a pattern at a line specified by __yourLineNumber and i__</code></p>
      <p><code>sed -i '/pattern to delete/d' file.html  #deletes a pattern</code></p>
      <p><code>sed -i '26d' file.html #deletes line number 26</code></p>
      <p><code>sed -n '18,24 p' file.html #displays lines 18-24 from the file. Does not modify them</code></p>
      <p><a href="http://ccm.net/faq/1451-delete-lines-from-a-file-using-sed" target="_blank">Here is a webpage to some helpful commands.</a></p>
      <p>Note that the -i wildcard changes the files permanently, whereas omitting the -i wildcard prints the result to the output.</p>
